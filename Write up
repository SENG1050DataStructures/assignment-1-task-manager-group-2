Josh's Writeup:
Abdullah completed two functionalities - FindTaskByIndex & FreeList.

FindTaskByIndex() iterates through the linked list until either:
a) It finds a NULL ptr - either the head being null or having reached the end of the list.
	In this case it returns a NULL Task*
b) It has iterated to the correct index in the list
	In this case it returns the Task* found there

FreeList() iterates through until it finds a NULL ptr.
In each iteration, it stores the next item in the list in a temp variable & deletes the current item.
