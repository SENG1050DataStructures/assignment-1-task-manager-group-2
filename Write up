Josh's Writeup:
Abdullah completed two functionalities - FindTaskByIndex & FreeList.

FindTaskByIndex() iterates through the linked list until either:
a) It finds a NULL ptr - either the head being null or having reached the end of the list.
	In this case it returns a NULL Task*
b) It has iterated to the correct index in the list
	In this case it returns the Task* found there

FreeList() iterates through until it finds a NULL ptr.
In each iteration, it stores the next item in the list in a temp variable & deletes the current item.

Marcus completed two functionalities - addToHead and addToTail.

addToHead() adds a new Task node to the beginning of the linked list by using the createNode() function.
It will then check if the list is not empty, if it is not then the new node's (Task) NextTask pointer is set to the current
head of the list, making it the new head of the list

addToTail appends a new Task node to the end of the Linked list by also using the createNode() function.
It then checks if the linked list is empty (if *head is null), if it is then the new node is simply set as the head of the list.
If it's not empty then the function will iterate through the list until it reaches the last node, once it reaches the last node then
the last node's NextTask pointer will be set to point to the new node.

Marcus's Writeup:
Josh R's menu is a while loop that will wait for the person to select "exit" otherwise itll keep running, and itll use "escape codes" to wipe the screen and redo every loop. 
If the person selects a correct menu item it'll switch to the function that calls it, if the person doesnt input a valid menu item itll say invalid.
He also created the CreateNode function which uses Malloc to create a new Task, and then prompts the user to fill out details.

Joseph completed two functionalities - DeleteTaskByTaskId & PrintTasks.

  DeleteTaskByTaskId() 
	a) Asks the user for a task ID & checks for an empty list.
	b) It iterates through the list until the end of the list OR the correct TaskId is found. 
	c) If the ID wasn't found, print an error message.
	d) If it's found the ID, it deletes the entered Task.
  PrintTasks()
	a) if no task prints no tasks are found.
	b) Iterates through the list and prints TaskID, Task Title, and Task Description.
